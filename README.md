## 📖 Overview
**CL Meter** is a lightweight, fully customizable network speed monitor designed for especially Windows 11 as Microsoft removed the native "Taskbar Toolbars" API which restricts alternative speed meter intigration in the taskbar. It floats seamlessly on your taskbar, providing real-time Download and Upload speeds without cluttering your workspace.

Unlike other paid alternatives, CL Meter is completely **free to use**, privacy-focused, and packed with advanced tracking features like historical data usage and daily reports.

    * Toggle **Transparent Background** (Ghost Mode).
    * Adjust Width, Height, Font Size, and Arrow Size independently.
    * Choose from multiple Indicator Styles (⬇⬆, D: U:, ⇩⇧, etc.).
* **Smart Traffic Tracking:**
    * Internal database tracks usage automatically.
    * View **Daily**, **Weekly**, and **All-Time** data totals.
    * Visual **Bar Graph** for the last 7 days of activity.
* **User Friendly:**
    * System Tray Icon for quick access.
    * "Lock Position" to prevent accidental dragging.
    * Auto-start with Windows (via Installer).
